# Causal Test Efficacy

This is a replication package for the research paper written in R programming language. The implementation is heavily based on Rethinking package, a popular library for Bayesian computation.
Each research question is answered in a file with the same name. For example, RQ1.R answeres the first research question in the paper.

You need to install R and R studio in order to run the program and reproduce the results.
